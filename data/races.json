When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction. It makes noises as appropriate to the creature it represents.\n*Fire Starter.* The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires your action.\n*Music Box.* When opened, this music box plays a single song at a moderate volume. The box stops playing when it reaches the song’s end or when it is closed."
